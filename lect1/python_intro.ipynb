    "Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.\n",
